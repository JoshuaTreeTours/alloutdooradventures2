# Images directory

Images will be manually uploaded later in `.webp` or `.jpg` format.

## Naming recommendations

- Use lowercase filenames.
- Prefer slug-style names (e.g., words separated by hyphens).

## Examples

- `/public/images/california/hero.webp`
- `/public/images/california/cities/san-francisco.webp`
